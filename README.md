# Plugin Information

To disable reading Parking Meters use the **/EndMeters** command.

Once is player is within a few feet of the Parking Meter a prompt will appear to allow the player to read the meter. Once the animation is complete the plugin will notify the player if the Meter is expired or has time left.

Every five minutes after starting the plugin some of the meters you have previously read will be available to read again.\
A message and notification will display to get the player's attention. This works in a first in first out manner to allow the first meters read to be reset first.
